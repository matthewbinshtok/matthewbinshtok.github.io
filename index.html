<!-- Assignment - Day 1:
     Create your own profile site in HTML and link to a CSS page with styling.
     This page should be all about you! Tell us about who you are and what your
     interests are. This should be at least 2 pages linked together, utilizing
     Flexbox to make it responsive.
     Get creative with the CSS and have fun exploring all that CSS can do!
     Grading Criteria:
          * HTML template is formatted correctly and all elements are indented/nested properly.
          * Profile info added in (but not limited to) tags: img, h1, p, ul, li
          * The title is customized to your preference (what you'd want the tab to read in the browser)
          * Absolute/relative paths work properly
          * CSS is in a separate stylesheet and linked properly
          * Flexbox has been properly implemented
          * Every element on the page has some sort of styling added to it (ie; color, border, text decoration, etc)
